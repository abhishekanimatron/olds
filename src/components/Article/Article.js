        NEW DELHI: Amit Gupta, a 39-year-old doctor with a Delhi government-run
        hospital, who was at the forefront fighting the pandemic, died due to
        Covid-related multi-organ failure. He had been battling the deadly
        infection since April.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Gupta was on Covid-19 duty at Satyawadi Raja Harish Chandra Hospital
        before he tested positive on April 22, a close aide of the family said.
        He added that, since no extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)
        support was available in the capital, he had to be airlifted to
        Secunderabad as doctors advised a lung transplant. “He died due to
        multi-organ failure. We couldn’t save him,” one of his family members
        told TOI.<br></br>
        <br></br> The family had spent their entire savings on his treatment.
        They had to even borrow money from friends, relatives and other people.
        Recently, Delhi government, on the directions of National Human Rights
        Commission (NHRC), reimbursed nearly Rs 83 lakh incurred in Dr Gupta’s
        treatment. The statement issued on Thursday said Dr Gupta was initially
        denied any financial assistance after getting infected with Covid-19.
        The commission, based on a complaint, had issued a notice to the Union
        health ministry and Delhi government asking to extend immediate
        financial assistance and other support to the ailing doctor.
        <br></br>
        <br></br> It had also asked both the governments to frame a policy for
        all the contractual medical and paramedical staff deployed by the Centre
        or state governments. Delhi government informed that Director General
        Health Services had been assigned the task of framing a policy for
        providing adequate medical care to the doctors and paramedical staff
        hired on contract-basis, which might include medical insurance for them,
        said NHRC
